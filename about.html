            <p>This site is meant to be a one-stop solution for canonical sort algorithms you'll 
                encounter on the job and in your data structures and algorithms journey.</p>
            <p>Want to visualize what each iteration of these different sort algorithms looks like via both pictures and animated visualizations?
                Have you ever wanted to see how quickly each sort algorithm sorts with respect to varying array sizes while also being able to 
                read code solutions and step by step explanations? This might be a great starting point to either dive into 
                the world of sorting algorithms or to dust off some cobwebs.
